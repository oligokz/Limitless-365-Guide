# Welcome to Microsoft 365! üöÄ

Welcome to the team! This guide will help you get started with Microsoft 365 (M365), our primary platform for communication, collaboration, and file storage. Think of it as your digital office.

## Part 1: Your First Login

Your first step is to sign in and get familiar with your new digital workspace.

### How to Log In

1.  Open any web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
2.  Go to **[office.com](https://office.com)**.
3.  Enter your work email address: `[e.g., your.name@company.com]`.
4.  Enter the temporary password provided by `[e.g., the IT Department]`. You will be prompted to create a new, secure password.

### The M365 Home Page

After logging in, you'll see your M365 home page. The most important feature here is the **App Launcher** (Select Apps on the left of your screen)
> [!NOTE]
> Select Outlook for your first run if you are new to Microsoft 365

## Part 2: Your Core Apps  

These three apps will be central to your daily work.

### üìß Outlook: Your Email and Calendar = Google Gmail  
<img width="3837" height="1639" alt="{E5DFE76C-ED5A-4208-8E61-D6280DEB7FE2}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39c9cbc9-fa8e-49b5-874c-ce5c7a60bc40" />


This is where you'll manage your emails and schedule.

* **To Check Email:** Click the **Outlook** icon from the App Launcher. Your inbox will be displayed.
* **To View Your Calendar:** Inside Outlook, find the **calendar icon** on the left-hand navigation bar.
* **To Create a Meeting:** Go to your calendar, click the **"New Event"** button, fill in the details, and invite attendees by typing their names.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è OneDrive: Your Personal File Storage = Google Personal Drive  
<img width="3840" height="1633" alt="{47C77E6C-98D7-4203-8482-568D10A75B25}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b342840-a948-4080-a377-22b94bf4756c" />  
Think of OneDrive as your personal C: drive, but in the cloud. It's where you should save all your individual work files.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Shared Folders are currently segmentated by department and you should see them on the Quick Access bar  
* **Access Your Files Anywhere:** You can access your OneDrive files from any device by logging into `office.com`.
* **Saving Files:** When working in apps like Word or Excel, choose **"Save As"** and select your OneDrive.
* **Sharing Files:** To share a file, click the **Share** button next to the filename. This is better than sending attachments because it ensures everyone is working on the latest version.

### üìÇ SharePoint: Your Team File Storage & Intranet

If OneDrive is your personal drive, SharePoint is your team's **shared network drive**. It‚Äôs where files and resources for departments, projects, and the entire company are stored.

* **Team Sites:** Each department or major project has a "Team Site." This is the central place to find all shared documents, lists, and resources relevant to that team.
* **Company Intranet:** SharePoint also powers our company's main intranet page `[e.g., link to your company's SharePoint homepage]`. Visit it for company-wide news, HR documents, and official announcements.
* **Accessing Files:** You can access SharePoint files directly through a link, from the M365 home page, or through the "Files" tab in a connected Microsoft Teams channel.

### üí¨ Microsoft Teams: Your Communication Hub

Teams is the central hub where communication and collaboration happen. It brings together chat, meetings, and files (from SharePoint) into one place.

* **Chat:** Use the Chat tab for direct messages and small group conversations. This is for quick, informal communication.
* **Teams and Channels:** Projects and departments are organized into "Teams." Inside each Team are "Channels" for specific topics or workstreams. All conversations and files for that topic stay in the channel, keeping everything organized and transparent.
* **Meetings:** You can join scheduled meetings from your calendar or start an instant video call with colleagues directly from a chat or channel.
* **Files Tab:** Every channel has a "Files" tab at the top. This tab is directly connected to the team's SharePoint site, so it's where you'll find all the documents related to that channel's topic.

## Part 3: Essential Tips

* **Web vs. Desktop Apps:** You can use M365 apps directly in your web browser, or you can install the desktop versions for more features. We recommend installing the desktop versions of **Outlook** and **Teams**.\
`[ONLY AVAILABLE FOR USERS WITH THE MICROSOFT STANDARD LICENSE]`\
`[TEAMS APP IS FREE, PERSONALLY I PREFER THE APP VERSION BUT IT'S YOUR CHOICE!]`

* **Use the Search Bar:** The search bar at the top of the M365 home page is very powerful. It can find files, chats, emails, and people across all your apps.
* **Get the Mobile Apps:** Install Outlook and Teams on your phone to stay connected on the go.\

* ### How to Register for 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) üì±\

`[AS 29 AUG 2025, 2FA IS NOT ENFORCED YET - WE WILL NOTIFY EVERYONE ONCE IT IS SO YOU CAN SKIP THIS STEP]`

2FA adds a crucial layer of security to your account. You will be prompted to set this up during your first login. The recommended method is using the Microsoft Authenticator app on your smartphone.

1.  **Download the App:** Before you log in for the first time, go to your phone's app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and install the free **Microsoft Authenticator** app.
2.  **Start the Process:** During your first login on your computer, you will see a "More information required" prompt. Click **"Next"**.
3.  **Scan the QR Code:** On the "Keep your account secure" screen, select **"Mobile app"** from the dropdown list. A QR code will appear on your computer screen.
4.  **Connect Your Phone:** Open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your phone. Tap the plus `+` icon to add an account, select "Work or school account," and then choose "Scan a QR code."
5.  **Approve the Sign-in:** Use your phone's camera to scan the QR code on your computer screen. Once it's linked, your computer screen will update. The app will then send a test notification to your phone. Tap **"Approve"** to complete the setup.
